## Introduction

R and Python are computer programming languages and environments where statistical and data science techniques are performed. These two languages can be used together for more effective design and analysis.

# Reticulate

The reticulate package allows easier interplay between R and Python.  
```{R}
#install.packages("reticulate")
library(reticulate)
py_config()
use_python("/usr/bin/python")
py_install("seaborn")


```


The code will run like this in R: 
```{R}
py_run_string("import numpy as np")
py_run_string("my_python_array = np.array([2,4,6,8])")


```

The same code will run like this with python embedded into R. You can perform vectorized arithmetic with numpy.
```{python}
import numpy as np
my_array = np.array([2,4,6,8])
for item in my_python_array:
    print(item)
    
print(my_array/4+2) 

```


# Select and Filter with Seaborn Dataset 
```{python}
import seaborn as sns
df = sns.load_dataset('diamonds')
df

(df.filter(['depth', 'cut'])
 .query('cut == "Ideal"').head(5))
```
